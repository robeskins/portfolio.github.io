                    <br>In this project I set out to research the process of forming an image using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR). Firstly, I set out to explain the fundamentals of NMR and how a signal can be detected when a nuclei is placed in a magnetic field and pulsed with a specific radio wave. This is explained using both a quantum interpretation and a classical interpretation. Once this was explained, I could go onto explaining the spin-spin relaxation time and the spin-lattice relaxation time. Secondly, I went through the early history of MRI imaging and how an image can be formed from the signal given off by nuclei as they were put into an excited state and how a slice can be imaged in the body using gradient magnetic fields. The last fundamental concept of imaging was to explain why we record in K-Space and take a 2D Fourier transform to then get an image from the patient.  Thirdly, with the use of K-Space, techniques were researched to increase scan time and resolution. This was due to the social impact of faster scans and more detail. Attached is the research paper.

                <h2><u>Key Skills</u></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 100 hours of data collection skills used for various experiments throughout my degree.This includes keeping a good laboratory book and being organised to finish data collection in the time given.</li>
                    <li>Data analysis using data plotting software and computational methods to reduce analysis time for large data samples.</li>
                    <li>Report writing skills, involving explaining complex experimental data in a clear logically wayso the reader can easily follow.</li>
                    <li>Intermediate coding skills using the python language. This was used to simulate experiments such as a two-body gravity simulator, cosmic ray cloud chamber detector, heat transfer within arod, and Fresnel Diffraction. This also included mathematical models such as Monto Carlo probability simulator and a linear algebra calculator that would solve complex simultaneous equations. This is an aspect of the course I thoroughly enjoyed. Taking the third year optional module, I improved on these skills and would like to further my coding experience in my career.</li>
                    <li>Mathematical skills, in particular Statistics, Calculus and Linear algebra. Used to solve real-world problems such as Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics and Electrodynamics. This is evidentin my exam results, in particular achieving 85% in Mathematical Physics and 83% in Quantum Physics where we used Dirac notation.</li>
                    <li>Research skills such as reading and understanding a large volume of expert research papers and extracting information. This is evident from my dissertation where I achieved 72% for my research paper.</li>
